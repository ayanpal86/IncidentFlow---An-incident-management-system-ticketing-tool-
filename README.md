# IncidentFlow---An-incident-management-system-ticketing-tool- 
*A live SLA-driven incident management system with ticket creation, automated escalation workflows, and real-time monitoring.*  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The **Incident Management System** simulates real-world IT service workflows such as **ticket creation, SLA monitoring, and escalation handling**. It enables users to track incidents efficiently and demonstrates knowledge of **SaaS support operations, REST API integration, and SOAP simulation**.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- âœ… **Ticket Management**: Create, update, and track incidents through statuses (Open, In Progress, Resolved).  
- âœ… **SLA-Driven Escalations**: Automatically prioritize and escalate incidents based on severity and SLA timelines.  
- âœ… **REST API Integration**: Fetch external incident-related data for better context and reporting.  
- âœ… **SOAP-Style Simulation**: Demonstrates XML-based service communication.  
- âœ… **Real-Time Deployment**: Hosted live on `.bolt.host` using Boltâ€™s AI-assisted builder.  

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bolt Components)  
- **Backend**: Bolt Framework  
- **APIs**: REST API integration & SOAP simulation  
- **Hosting**: Bolt `.bolt.host` (Cloud deployment)  

## ðŸ“‚ Features in Detail  
- **Incident Creation & Status Updates**: Log incidents and track their lifecycle.  
- **SLA Monitoring**: Track compliance and flag SLA breaches.  
- **Escalation Logic**: Automated prioritization based on severity (P1, P2, P3).  
- **Reporting Dashboard**: View open, in-progress, and resolved incidents with SLA status.  


## âš¡ Future Enhancements  
- Email notifications for SLA breaches and escalations.  
- Role-based access control (Admin, Support Agent).  
- Advanced reporting with Power BI or Tableau.
